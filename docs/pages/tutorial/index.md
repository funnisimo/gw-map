# Tutorial

This is the Goblinwerks tutorial. In it, we will build a game a little bit at a time. This allows you to get a feel for the parts of Goblinwerks.

The tutorial game will start as an adaptation of the [ROT.js tutorial](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php/Rot.js_tutorial,_part_1) and will go from there to be something a little more dungeon delvy.
